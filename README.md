Lavndr is a social networking "dating app" style of web application specifically tailored for members of the LGBTQA+ community to find platonic connections and build communities. 

Having a strong friend circle is ever so important for people under the LGBTQA+ umbrella, but it can often be hard to meet new people within one's local community if you don't know where to look. LGBTQA+ spaces often coincide with night life, i.e. bars and clubs, spaces that are often not tailored to the interests of some, or totally inaccessible to others. That is why we wanted to create this app, so LGBTQA+ individuals can build connections from the comfort and safety of their own spaces. 

The name Lavndr comes from the lavender flower which has commonly been used as a symbol for homosexuality since the 1950's. Although lavender was initially something associated with shame and persecution of homosexuals, it has since been reclaimed by the community.
